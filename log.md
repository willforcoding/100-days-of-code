	- [100 Days Of Web Development Path](https://100daysofcode.net/paths/100-days-challenge) - Udemy Course

- Googling on what course to take and decided on 5 courses based on my experiences (Please recommend me if you have any other course):

    - Learn to Code — For Free — Coding Courses for Busy People - [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

### **Thoughts**
Surprisingly there are many free and good resources out there. I will try the free one first. I like how markdown was used anywhere, so I decided to learn just enough to structure my logs. Also there are free services on Github to host your website.
