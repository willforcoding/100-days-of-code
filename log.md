### **Thoughts**
CSS can makes website beautiful and pleasing for the eyes. The important part of it are to select elements and declare the style. I face some difficulties when creating project when the CSS not work the way I think, like why we must put relative div for the child absolute can refer for the relative div. Why not just using relative. There are many things in CSS that I am not touching yet. Will try it as I need. Especially flex box and grid. CSS Art are awesome, so I make project that use CSS to draw object.

### **Questions**
When exploring I see there are many ways to draw in website, SVG, canvas and CSS. What are the use cases for each of them?
